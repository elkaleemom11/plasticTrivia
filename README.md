# Trivia Game 

**Totally Plastic Trivia**

- I made a trivia game with multiple choice questions.
- The user will have 15 seconds to answer each question. The game is over after all questions are answered.
- A pause will occur before the next question appears after the time runs out. 
- The page will reveal the number of questions the user answers correctly and/or incorrectly.
- The user cannot pick more than one answer per question.
- There is a countdown timer.
